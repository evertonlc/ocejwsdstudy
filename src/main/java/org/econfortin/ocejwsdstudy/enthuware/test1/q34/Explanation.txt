What should be in the faultCode of the SOAP Fault element when the content of a certain SOAP header cannot be processed
because the database connection is down?

soap:Server

The set of faultcode values defined in this document is:

VersionMismatch - The processing party found an invalid namespace for the SOAP Envelope element (see section 4.1.2)

MustUnderstand - An immediate child element of the SOAP Header element that was either not understood or not obeyed
    by the processing party contained a SOAP mustUnderstand attribute with a value of "1" (see section 4.2.3)

Client - The Client class of errors indicate that the message was incorrectly formed or did not contain the appropriate
    information in order to succeed. For example, the message could lack the proper authentication or payment information.
    It is generally an indication that the message should not be resent without change.
    See also section 4.4 for a description of the SOAP Fault detail sub-element.

Server - The Server class of errors indicate that the message could not be processed for reasons not directly attributable
    to the contents of the message itself but rather to the processing of the message.
    For example, processing could include communicating with an upstream processor, which didn't respond.
    The message may succeed at a later point in time.
