WS-I Basic Profile v1.1 does allow the use of DTD's.

From Basic Profile v1.1:

"XML DTDs and PIs may introduce security vulnerabilities, processing overhead and semantic ambiguity when used in envelopes.
As a result, certain XML constructs are disallowed by section 3 of SOAP 1.1.

R1008 An ENVELOPE MUST NOT contain a Document Type Declaration."
