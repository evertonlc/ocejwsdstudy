SOAP encoding is part of the SOAP v1.1 specifications. What are the correct statements about the encoding of compound values (valores compostos)?

Compound values can be encoded just like simple values.
It is possible to have compound values with several accessors each named the same.

SOAP encoding is not conform Basic Profile v1.1. however it is part of the SOAP v1.1. specifications and people have run into questions about it.

Please read and study the SOAP Encoding chapter of the SOAP v1.1. specs (http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/NOTE-SOAP-20000508/#_Toc478383512)
Especially the paragraph of 5.1 Rules for Encoding Types in XML.
