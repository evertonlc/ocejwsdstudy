What is the correct sequence of methods that must be added (in line //1 and line //2) in the following JAX-RS client to return a valid result.
The request should be a POST request with a String as body.

public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
    URL restURL = new URL("http://localhost:8080/SimpleRS/math/table/post");
    HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection) restURL.openConnection();
    // 1
    //connection.setRequestMethod("POST");
    //connection.setDoOutput(true);
    connection.connect();
    String entity = "5";
    // 2
    //DataOutputStream wr = new DataOutputStream(connection.getOutputStream());
    //wr.writeBytes(entity); wr.flush(); wr.close();
}
