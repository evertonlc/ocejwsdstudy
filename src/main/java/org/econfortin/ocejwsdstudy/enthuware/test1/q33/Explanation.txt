We have got a Web Service (JAX-WS) running as an EJB.
We have got 2 logical security roles: "Student" and "Teacher". In one of the methods createSchedule() we only want to
allow the "Teacher" to run the method and we want to log the user Principal's name.
How do we implement this requirement?

1) Enable Authentication in the web-container
2) Use @DeclareRoles({"Student", "Teacher"}) on the EJB and @RolesAllowed("Teacher")on the createSchedule() method
3) Let the WebServiceContext be injected in the EJB with @Resource
4) Invoke WebServiceContext.getUserPrincipal().getName() inside the createSchedule() method to get the user's name
