Important to know:
- An EJB always lives inside an EJB-container
- The JAX-RS runtime (and web-components like Servlets) in a Web-container. (check Java EE6 specifications JSR-316 Platform overview)

Jersey requires EJB's to be packaged in combination with a war file (to bootstrap the JAX-RS runtime).
The EJB classes can be packaged inside the war-file or in an ejb-jar file inside an ear-file.

JAX-RS is only required to support local EJB's
From JAX-RS v1.1.

6.2 Java EE Container
"In a product that also supports EJB, an implementation MUST support use of stateless and singleton session beans as root
resource classes, providers and Application subclasses. JAX-RS annotations MAY be applied to a beanâ€™s local interface or
directly to a no-interface bean.

From the EE6 (JSR-316) specs:
----
EE.6.3
"In a Java EE product that includes both an EJB-container and a Web-container, both containers are required to support
access to local enterprise beans."

For JAX-RS this requires the EJB-container and Web-container to run in the same JVM. The JAX-RS runtime locally accesses
the EJB's in the EJB-container from the Web-container.
