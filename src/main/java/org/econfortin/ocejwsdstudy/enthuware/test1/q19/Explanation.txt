We have a Web Service that returns a java.awt.Image from an Image database.
What should be done in order for the client to work directly with a java.awt.Image?

From JAXB 2.2

H.2 Binding MIME Binary Data As specified in [MIME], the XML Schema annotation attribute, xmime:expectedContentTypes,
lists the expected MIME contenttype(s) for element content whose type derives from the xsd binary datatypes, xs:base64Binary or xs:hexBinary.

JAXB 2.0 databinding recognizes this schema constraint to improve the binding of MIME type constrained binary data to Java representation.
The xmime:expectedContentType attribute is allowed on type definitions deriving from binary datatypes and on element
declarations with types that Enhanced Binary Data Handling derive from binary datatypes.
