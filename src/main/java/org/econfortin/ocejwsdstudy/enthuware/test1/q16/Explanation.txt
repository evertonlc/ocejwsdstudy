We want to attach handlers only to a WebService with a serviceName of "RunningService".
What is the correct way to configure that requirement in the file indicated by the @HandlerChain(file="handler-chain.xml") annotation.

From JSR-181

service-name-pattern
Specifies the QName of the WSDL service element defining the service to which the handler chain is bound. You can use * as a wildcard when defining the QName.

For instance: Exact Name: service-name-pattern="ns1:EchoService"
In this case, handlers specified in this handler-chain element will apply to all ports with this exact service name.
The namespace prefix must have been declared in a namespace declaration attribute in either the start-tag of the element
where the prefix is used or in an an ancestor element (in effect, an element in whose content the prefixed markup occurs)

Pattern : service-name-pattern="ns1:EchoService*"
In this case, handlers specified in this handler-chain element will apply to all ports whose Service names are like
EchoService1, EchoServiceFoo etc.
The namespace prefix must have been declared in a namespace declaration attribute in either the start-tag of the element
where the prefix is used or in an an ancestor element (in effect, an element in whose content the prefixed markup occurs)

Wild Card : service-name-pattern="*"
In this case, handlers specified in this handler-chain element will apply to ports of all service names.
