There is a RESTful Web Service (implemented by an EJB) that does some time consuming calculation.
We want to secure this Web Service in order to only allow users in the role "administrator".
Where can you configure the role-based method authorization?

1) Method permissions on EJB's are either configured in the ejb-jar.xml:
<method-permission>
    <role-name>employee</role-name>
    <method>
        <ejb-name>EjbName</ejb-name>
        <method-name>EjbMethod</method-name>
    </method>
</method-permission>

2) Or by Annotations
@RolesAllowed
@PermitAll
@DenyAll

The annotations all look like:
@Documented
@Retention(value=RUNTIME)
@Target(value={TYPE,METHOD})
public @interface RolesAllowed
which means that they can be used on the class (TYPE) or on a specific method (METHOD).
