A JAX-RS application can have an EJB as a root resource class. Which of the following package configurations is correct?

Packaging requirements for JAX-RS

An EJB can only be used as a JAX-RS root resource if it is deployed in a package that also contains a web-module.
This is to bootstrap the JAX-RS runtime. (https://jersey.java.net/documentation/latest/deployment.html#deployment.javaee.ejb)

There are a couple of packaging options:
1) .war (with an ejb .jar file)
2) .ear including an .war (with an ejb .jar file)
3) .ear including an .war and an ejb .jar file

Note that a .war file has two options to package an EJB:
1) either as an ejb .jar file in the /WEB-INF/lib, or
2) directly package the ejb classes in the /WEB-INF/classes
