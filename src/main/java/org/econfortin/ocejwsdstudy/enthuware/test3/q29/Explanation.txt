Which of the following security frameworks emphasize on Authorization?

Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML)
SAML deals with Authentication, Authorization and Multi-domain web Single Sign-On (SSO) which is arguably the most
    important use case for which SAML is applied.

Extensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML)
The standard defines a declarative access control policy language implemented in XML and a processing model describing
    how to evaluate access requests according to the rules defined in policies.
