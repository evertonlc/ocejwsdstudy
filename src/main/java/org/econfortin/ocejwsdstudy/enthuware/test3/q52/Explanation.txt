SwA defines a multi-part MIME structure for packaging attachments with SOAP messages.
    The structure contains a primary SOAP envelope in its root part and one or more attachments in additional MIME parts.
    However these attachments are not part of the SOAP envelope.

WS-Security describes how to protect (secure) SOAP-messages and uses the SOAP header for that.
    It doesn't define anything for additional MIME parts (as they are not part of the SOAP envelope) so you need use
    an extra feature to secure the attachments.
