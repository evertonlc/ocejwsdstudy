From Basic Profile v1.1

You can have multiple wsdl:portType elements in a WSDL.

R2304 A wsdl:portType in a DESCRIPTION MUST have operations with distinct values for their name attributes.

Note that this requirement applies only to the wsdl:operations within a given wsdl:portType.
A wsdl:portType may have wsdl:operations with names that are the same as those found in other wsdl:portTypes.
