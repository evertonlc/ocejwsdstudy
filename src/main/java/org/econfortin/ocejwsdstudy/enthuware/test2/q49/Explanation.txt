The following message is sent from Sender to Receiver travelling through 2 intermediate nodes.
<soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
   <soap:Header>
      <first:Trans
            soap:actor="http://enthuware.ws.notes/fifthNode/"
            xmlns:first="http://enthuware.ws.notes/fifth/">1</first:Trans>
      <second:Time
            soap:actor="http://enthuware.ws.notes/secondNode/"
            xmlns:second="http://enthuware.ws.notes/second/">2</second:Time>
      <third:Stamp
            xmlns:third="http://enthuware.ws.notes/third/">3</third:Stamp>
      <fourth:Jump
            soap:actor="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/actor/next"
            xmlns:fourth="http://enthuware.ws.notes/fourth/">4</fourth:Jump>
   </soap:Header>
</soap:Envelope>

The nodes identified by their URI's:
Sender: http://enthuware.ws.notes/firstNode/
Node 2: http://enthuware.ws.notes/secondNode/
Node 3: http://enthuware.ws.notes/thirdNode/
Receiver: http://enthuware.ws.notes/fourthNode/
What happens to the header elements when this message travels from Sender to Receiver?

first:Trans não vai ser processado por nenhum nodo, visto que não existe ator no caminho para processar o soap:actor dele
second:time vai ser processado e removido pelo Node 2
third:stamp vai ser processado pelo Receiver, já que não existe soap:actor para processá-lo
fourth:Jump vai ser processado e removido pelo Node 2.

SOAP v1.1
A SOAP message travels from the originator to the ultimate destination, potentially by passing through a set of SOAP
intermediaries along the message path.
A SOAP intermediary is an application that is capable of both receiving and forwarding SOAP messages.
Both intermediaries as well as the ultimate destination are identified by a URI.

Not all parts of a SOAP message may be intended for the ultimate destination of the SOAP message but, instead, may be
intended for one or more of the intermediaries on the message path. The role of a recipient of a header element is
similar to that of accepting a contract in that it cannot be extended beyond the recipient. That is, a recipient
receiving a header element MUST NOT forward that header element to the next application in the SOAP message path.
The recipient MAY insert a similar header element but in that case, the contract is between that application and the
recipient of that header element.

The SOAP actor global attribute can be used to indicate the recipient of a header element. The value of the SOAP actor
attribute is a URI. The special URI "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/actor/next" indicates that the header element is
intended for the very first SOAP application that processes the message. This is similar to the hop-by-hop scope model
represented by the Connection header field in HTTP.

Omitting the SOAP actor attribute indicates that the recipient is the ultimate destination of the SOAP message.
