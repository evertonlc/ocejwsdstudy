The following terms are important:

Service Oriented Architecture
SOA is an architectural style based on software parts that provide application functionality as services to other applications.
It is independent of any vendor, product, technology, or industry trend.

SOA vs. Web Services
SOAs may be implemented by Web services but Web services are not necessarily required to implement SOA

SOA vs. SOAP
SOA is an architectural style, SOAP a communication protocol

Web Service (W3C)
A software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network.
It has an interface described in a machine-processable format (specifically WSDL).
Other systems interact with the Web Service in a manner prescribed by its description using SOAP messages,
typically conveyed using HTTP with an XML serialization in conjunction with other Web-related standards
Its architecture consists of:
1) Service Requester (communication request-provider via SOAP, request-broker via WSDL)
2) Service Provider (communication provider-broker via WSDL)
3) Service Broker (UDDI)

SOAP (W3C)
SOAP is a lightweight protocol for exchange of information in a decentralized, distributed environment.
It is an XML based protocol that consists of three parts: an envelope that defines a framework for describing what is
in a message and how to process it, a set of encoding rules for expressing instances of application-defined datatypes,
and a convention for representing remote procedure calls and responses. SOAP can potentially be used in combination
with a variety of other protocols;

Services
Services are software components with well-defined interfaces that are implementation-independent.
