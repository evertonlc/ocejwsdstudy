(WSIT) - Web Services Interoperability Technology
    From the WSIT tutorial v1.0

    The security standards are
    1) Web Services Security
    2) Web Services Security Policy
    3) Web Services Trust
    4) Web Services Secure Conversation

    The supporting standards are:
    1) Web Services Policy
    2) Web Services Addressing


(MTOM) - Message Transmission Optimization Mechanism
(SwA) - SOAP with Attachments
(XOP) - XML-binary Optimized Packaging
(I-Stack) - The Integrated Stack consists of JAX-WS, JAXB, StAX, SAAJ.
(STS) - Security Token Service
    Is a software based identity provider responsible for issuing security tokens, especially software tokens, as part
    of a claims-based identity system.
(XMKS) XML Key Management Specification
    Specifies protocols for distributing and registering public keys.
(SAML) - Security Assertion Markup Language
    Deals with Authentication, Authorization and Multi-domain web Single Sign-On (SSO) which is arguably the most
    important use case for which SAML is applied.
(XACML) - eXtensible Access Control Markup Language
    The standard defines a declarative access control policy language implemented in XML and a processing model
    describing how to evaluate access requests according to the rules defined in policies.

From WS-Security
    This specification provides three main mechanisms: ability to send security tokens as part of a message, message
    integrity, and message confidentiality.
The specification addresses:
Authentication - attach security tokens to SOAP messages
Integrity & Non-repudiation	 - signing of SOAP messages
Confidentiality - encrypting of SOAP messages

From W3C SOAP 1.1 Binding for MTOM 1.0  3.1 Serialization of a SOAP message
When sending a SOAP message using the MIME Multipart/Related Serialization, the SOAP envelope Infoset is serialized into XML 1.0 as specified in [XOP] 3.1 Creating XOP packages.
Specifically:  Specifically: The content-type of the outer package MUST be multipart/related.
The type parameter of the content-type header of the outer package MUST have a value of application/xop+xml

The content-type of the root part MUST be application/xop+xml The type parameter of the content-type header of the root part MUST specify a content-type of text/xml.
